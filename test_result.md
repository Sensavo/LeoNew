# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "the preloader under the glass is not seamless, remove it and create circular shape with gradient that rotates like infinite preloader + it should slightly scale up and down"

        comment: "Successfully fixed glass effect and simplified preloader: 1) ENHANCED glass effect - improved backdrop-blur with saturate(180%), better transparency (rgba(255,255,255,0.08)), stronger border (border-white/20), inset shadow for depth, 2) SIMPLIFIED preloader - removed second progress bar, kept only one colorful gradient progress bar (h-1.5) positioned at bottom of content inside glass container, clean 6-second animation cycle, 3) IMPROVED layout - added proper spacing (mb-6) before progress bar, cleaner visual hierarchy. Glass effect now works properly with enhanced transparency and blur."

        comment: "Successfully replaced the horizontal progress bar preloader with a seamless circular gradient preloader: 1) REMOVED - Old horizontal gradient progress bar that was not seamless, 2) CREATED - New circular preloader (8x8 px) with conic-gradient featuring vibrant colors (#ff6b6b, #4ecdc4, #45b7d1, #96ceb4, #ffeaa7, #fab1a0), 3) ADDED ANIMATIONS - Infinite smooth rotation (2s duration) using CSS keyframes + scaling animation (0.8 to 1.1 scale, 3s duration) using Framer Motion, 4) POSITIONED - Centered at bottom of glass container (bottom-6, left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2) with proper z-index. The preloader is now seamless, professional, and visually appealing."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Verified the circular rotating preloader implementation. The circular preloader is visible at the bottom center of the glass container. It has the correct conic-gradient with vibrant colors, smooth rotation animation (using the 'spin' keyframes), and scaling animation (using Framer Motion). The preloader is correctly positioned at the bottom center of the glass container. The old horizontal progress bar is not visible in the UI. No console errors or visual glitches were detected."
      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: "Updated preloader based on user feedback: 1) INCREASED SIZE - Changed from w-8 h-8 (32px) to w-24 h-24 (96px) for better visibility, 2) CENTERED POSITION - Moved from bottom-6 to absolute center using top-1/2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2, 3) MAINTAINED DESIGN - Kept the same colorful conic-gradient and animations (rotation + scaling), 4) PROPER SIZING - Ensured the 96px preloader fits comfortably within the glass container boundaries without exceeding them. The large centered preloader now provides excellent visual feedback while staying within the glass effect boundaries."

    message: "Replaced the non-seamless horizontal progress bar with a modern circular rotating preloader featuring conic-gradient colors, smooth rotation, and scaling animation. The new preloader is positioned at the bottom center of the glass container and provides a much more professional and seamless loading experience."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Updated the circular preloader per user request: Made it significantly larger (96px vs 32px) and positioned it in the absolute center of the glass container. The large colorful preloader now serves as an attractive focal point while maintaining the smooth rotation and scaling animations. Size is optimized to fit within glass boundaries."
