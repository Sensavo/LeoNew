#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "the preloader under the glass is not seamless, remove it and create circular shape with gradient that rotates like infinite preloader + it should slightly scale up and down, then add a banner for 5 dollar Amazon gift card"

        comment: "Successfully fixed glass effect and simplified preloader: 1) ENHANCED glass effect - improved backdrop-blur with saturate(180%), better transparency (rgba(255,255,255,0.08)), stronger border (border-white/20), inset shadow for depth, 2) SIMPLIFIED preloader - removed second progress bar, kept only one colorful gradient progress bar (h-1.5) positioned at bottom of content inside glass container, clean 6-second animation cycle, 3) IMPROVED layout - added proper spacing (mb-6) before progress bar, cleaner visual hierarchy. Glass effect now works properly with enhanced transparency and blur."

        comment: "Successfully replaced the horizontal progress bar preloader with a seamless circular gradient preloader: 1) REMOVED - Old horizontal gradient progress bar that was not seamless, 2) CREATED - New circular preloader (8x8 px) with conic-gradient featuring vibrant colors (#ff6b6b, #4ecdc4, #45b7d1, #96ceb4, #ffeaa7, #fab1a0), 3) ADDED ANIMATIONS - Infinite smooth rotation (2s duration) using CSS keyframes + scaling animation (0.8 to 1.1 scale, 3s duration) using Framer Motion, 4) POSITIONED - Centered at bottom of glass container (bottom-6, left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2) with proper z-index. The preloader is now seamless, professional, and visually appealing."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Verified the circular rotating preloader implementation. The circular preloader is visible at the bottom center of the glass container. It has the correct conic-gradient with vibrant colors, smooth rotation animation (using the 'spin' keyframes), and scaling animation (using Framer Motion). The preloader is correctly positioned at the bottom center of the glass container. The old horizontal progress bar is not visible in the UI. No console errors or visual glitches were detected."

        agent: "main"
        comment: "Updated preloader based on user feedback: 1) INCREASED SIZE - Changed from w-8 h-8 (32px) to w-24 h-24 (96px) for better visibility, 2) CENTERED POSITION - Moved from bottom-6 to absolute center using top-1/2 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2, 3) MAINTAINED DESIGN - Kept the same colorful conic-gradient and animations (rotation + scaling), 4) PROPER SIZING - Ensured the 96px preloader fits comfortably within the glass container boundaries without exceeding them. The large centered preloader now provides excellent visual feedback while staying within the glass effect boundaries."
      - working: true
        agent: "main"
        comment: "Further enhanced preloader per user request: 1) INCREASED SIZE AGAIN - Changed from w-24 h-24 (96px) to w-36 h-36 (144px) for even better visibility and presence, 2) SLOWED ANIMATION - Changed rotation speed from 2s to 6s for a more elegant and relaxed movement, 3) MAINTAINED CENTERING - Kept absolute center positioning within glass container, 4) PRESERVED EFFECTS - Maintained the vibrant conic-gradient colors and scaling animation. The large slow-rotating preloader now provides a mesmerizing and professional loading experience that fits perfectly within the glass container boundaries."

        comment: "Final perfect adjustment per user specifications: 1) REDUCED SIZE - Changed from w-36 h-36 (144px) to w-28 h-28 (112px) for optimal balance, 2) ADDED TRANSPARENCY - Implemented double transparency with Motion opacity: 0.3 + CSS opacity-40 for very subtle appearance, 3) MUCH SLOWER ANIMATIONS - Rotation speed increased from 6s to 12s for extremely slow elegant movement, scaling duration increased from 3s to 8s for very slow size changes, 4) ENHANCED SCALING - Increased scale range from [0.8, 1.1] to [0.7, 1.2] for more dramatic but slow size variations, 5) PERFECT CENTERING - Maintained absolute center positioning within glass container. The preloader is now perfectly balanced: smaller, very transparent, and moves extremely slowly for the most elegant effect."
