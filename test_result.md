# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
  - task: "Backend API Health Check"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Performed backend health check after frontend changes. All API endpoints are functioning correctly: 1) Root endpoint (/api/) returns 'Hello World', 2) POST /api/status successfully creates status check entries, 3) GET /api/status successfully retrieves status check entries. Created and executed backend_test.py to verify functionality."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "Successfully designed an enhanced hero background with dynamic animated gradients, floating geometric shapes, and subtle pattern overlays. Added multiple animated circles and shapes that move in different patterns and timings to create depth and visual interest while maintaining the light theme aesthetic. The background now features smooth color transitions, floating elements, grid lines, and enhanced patterns that complement the glass morphism design."

  - task: "Redesign Premium Sites Section with Brand-Accurate Representations"
    implemented: true

        comment: "Completely redesigned the 'Works on Premium Sites That Block Others' section with brand-accurate representations. Replaced generic colored squares with proper brand letters and colors: Forbes (F in blue), Wired (W in black), Bloomberg (B in blue), Business Insider (BI in red), The Atlantic (A in indigo), The Verge (V in orange). Added domain names, enhanced status indicators with animations, verification badges, hover effects, and subtle background animations. Also enhanced the additional sites banner with matching brand representations, success statistics (500+ sites, 99.9% success rate, 0% detection), and improved visual hierarchy with backdrop blur effects and patterns."

    message: "Successfully completed the continuation task requirements: 1) ENHANCED HERO BACKGROUND - Created a dynamic, visually engaging hero background with animated gradients that smoothly transition between light blue and white tones, multiple floating geometric shapes with different animation patterns, enhanced pattern overlays, and subtle grid lines. Added 5 animated floating elements with various sizes, colors, and movement patterns to create depth while maintaining the light theme aesthetic. 2) REDESIGNED PREMIUM SITES SECTION - Completely transformed the sites section with brand-accurate representations using proper brand letters and colors (Forbes=F blue, Wired=W black, Bloomberg=B blue, Business Insider=BI red, Atlantic=A indigo, Verge=V orange), added domain names for authenticity, enhanced with animated status indicators, verification badges, and subtle hover effects. Enhanced the additional sites banner with matching brand representations, success statistics (500+ sites compatible, 99.9% success rate, 0% detection), and improved visual hierarchy. The overall design now looks much more professional and engaging while maintaining the clean light theme established in previous iterations."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Performed backend health check after frontend changes. Created and executed backend_test.py to verify all API endpoints are functioning correctly. All tests passed successfully: 1) Root endpoint (/api/) returns 'Hello World' as expected, 2) POST /api/status correctly creates status check entries in the database, 3) GET /api/status successfully retrieves status check entries including newly created ones. The backend is stable and working properly after the frontend changes."
