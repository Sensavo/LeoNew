# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
  - task: "Backend API Health Check"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Performed backend health check after frontend changes. All API endpoints are functioning correctly: 1) Root endpoint (/api/) returns 'Hello World', 2) POST /api/status successfully creates status check entries, 3) GET /api/status successfully retrieves status check entries. Created and executed backend_test.py to verify functionality."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Performed backend health check after frontend changes. Created and executed backend_test.py to verify all API endpoints are functioning correctly. All tests passed successfully: 1) Root endpoint (/api/) returns 'Hello World' as expected, 2) POST /api/status correctly creates status check entries in the database, 3) GET /api/status successfully retrieves status check entries including newly created ones. The backend is stable and working properly after the frontend changes."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the restructured React application. All components are functioning correctly after breaking down the monolithic App.js into modular components. VERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY: 1) Preloader appears and disappears correctly, 2) Hero section loads with proper animations and branding, 3) Privacy checkbox and Chrome Store button interactions work as expected, 4) HeroVisualization component displays correctly with animations, 5) Features section with premium sites grid renders properly, 6) FAQ accordion expands/collapses correctly, 7) Testimonials display properly, 8) Footer links and interactions work, 9) Privacy modal opens and closes correctly, 10) Responsive design works across different screen sizes. No console errors were detected. All Framer Motion animations are working correctly including floating shapes, gradients, and hover effects. The application maintains the same functionality as before restructuring while having a more maintainable, modular architecture."
