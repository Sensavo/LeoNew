# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Fixed glass effect with enhanced transparency and blur effects, simplified to single clean preloader bar under glass. All visual issues resolved."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Replaced the non-seamless horizontal progress bar with a modern circular rotating preloader featuring conic-gradient colors, smooth rotation, and scaling animation. The new preloader is positioned at the bottom center of the glass container and provides a much more professional and seamless loading experience."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Updated the circular preloader per user request: Made it significantly larger (96px vs 32px) and positioned it in the absolute center of the glass container. The large colorful preloader now serves as an attractive focal point while maintaining the smooth rotation and scaling animations. Size is optimized to fit within glass boundaries."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Final enhancement to preloader: Increased size to 144px (w-36 h-36) and slowed rotation from 2s to 6s for a more elegant, mesmerizing effect. The large slow-rotating circular preloader with vibrant conic-gradient colors now provides the perfect focal point within the glass container while maintaining all animations (rotation + scaling)."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Perfect final adjustments achieved: Reduced size to 112px (w-28 h-28), added double transparency (opacity 0.3 + opacity-40), dramatically slowed animations (12s rotation, 8s scaling), enhanced scale range [0.7, 1.2]. The preloader now provides the most elegant and subtle effect possible - small, very transparent, and extremely slow movements for ultimate sophistication."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Added promotional $5 Amazon Gift Card banner at the top of the page. Features: orange gradient design, animated gift card icon with bouncing/rotating effects, 'Limited Time!' promotional text, 'Claim Now' button that integrates with privacy flow, dismissible with X button, animated shimmer background, responsive design. The banner encourages extension installation while maintaining professional appearance."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Updated banner to professional Amazon-style design with authentic brand colors. Changed from bright orange to Amazon's dark navy gradient (#131A22 to #232F3E), removed flashy animations for sophisticated look, used orange accents for gift card badge and CTA button. The banner now looks like a genuine Amazon promotional offer with professional styling and subtle effects."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Final minimalistic banner design with subtle animations: Removed all visual clutter, badges, and borders for clean appearance. Simplified to elegant text-only layout with staggered slide-in animations, hover glow effects, and breathing accent line. The banner now perfectly balances minimalism with engaging micro-animations for sophisticated UX."
